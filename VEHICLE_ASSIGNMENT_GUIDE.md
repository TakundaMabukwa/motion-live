# üöó Vehicle Assignment to Jobs Guide
## üìã Overview

This guide explains how the vehicle assignment feature works. When a technician scans a VIN or creates a new vehicle, it gets automatically assigned to the job card.

## üîß How It Works

### **1. VIN Scanning Process**
1. **Technician clicks "Scan Vehicle VIN"** on any job card
2. **VinScanner opens** with the job context
3. **VIN is scanned or entered** manually
4. **System searches** for existing vehicle in database
5. **If found**: Vehicle details are assigned to job
6. **If not found**: New vehicle form opens, technician fills details
7. **Vehicle is created** and assigned to job

### **2. Database Updates**

#### **cust_quotes Table**
- `selected_vehicles` field is updated with the VIN number
- `updated_at` timestamp is updated

#### **quote_products Table**
- `vehicle` array field is updated with complete vehicle details:
  ```json
  {
    "vin_number": "1HGBH41JXMN109186",
    "registration_number": "CA 123 GP",
    "make": "honda",
    "model": "civic",
    "manufactured_year": 2019,
    "color": "black",
    "fuel_type": "petrol",
    "transmission_type": "manual",
    "engine_number": "ENG987654321",
    "vehicle_type": "sedan",
    "action": "found", // or "created"
    "assigned_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "assigned_by": "tech@example.com"
  }
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints

### **POST /api/jobs/[id]/assign-vehicle**
Assigns vehicle details to a specific job.

**Request Body:**
```json

    "engine_number": "ENG987654321",
    "vehicle_type": "sedan"
  },
  "action": "found" // or "created"
}
```

**Response:**
