# First-Time Login Password Change Setup

## Overview

This implementation adds a first-time login password change functionality to the application. When users log in for the first time, they will be required to change their default password before accessing the system.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically detects first-time logins
- **Password Validation**: Strong password requirements (8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
- **Secure Flow**: Users cannot access protected routes until they change their password
- **Role-Based Redirect**: After password change, users are redirected to their appropriate dashboard

## Database Changes

### 1. Add First Login Field

Run the SQL script to add the `first_login` field to the users table:

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: add_first_login_field.sql
```

This adds a `first_login` boolean field that defaults to `true` for all users.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`add_first_login_field.sql`** - Database migration script
2. **`components/first-time-password-form.tsx`** - Password change form component
3. **`app/auth/first-time-login/page.tsx`** - First-time login page
4. **`components/login-form.tsx`** - Updated to check first_login status
5. **`middleware.ts`** - Updated to redirect first-time users
6. **`lib/auth-utils.ts`** - Utility functions for role-based redirects and user management

### Flow

1. User logs in with default credentials
2. System checks `first_login` field in users table
3. If `first_login = true`, redirect to `/auth/first-time-login`
4. User must change password with validation
5. System updates password and sets `first_login = false`
6. User is automatically logged in and redirected to their role-specific dashboard
7. User can now access all protected routes based on their role

### Password Requirements

- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number

## Usage

### For New Users

1. Admin creates user account with default password
2. User logs in with default credentials
3. System automatically redirects to password change page
4. User sets new password
5. User gains access to their dashboard

### For Existing Users

- All existing users will have `first_login = true` by default
- They will be prompted to change their password on next login

## Security Features

- **Middleware Protection**: Users cannot bypass the password change requirement
- **Session Validation**: Password change is tied to the authenticated session
- **Database Tracking**: First login status is stored securely in the database
- **Automatic Redirect**: Seamless flow from login to password change to dashboard
- **Role-Based Access**: Users are automatically redirected to their appropriate dashboard based on their role

## Utility Functions

The `lib/auth-utils.ts` file provides reusable functions for authentication and user management:

- **`redirectToRoleDashboard()`**: Redirects users to their role-specific dashboard
- **`getUserRole()`**: Fetches user role information
- **`isFirstTimeLogin()`**: Checks if user needs to complete first-time setup

These utilities ensure consistent behavior across the application and make the code more maintainable.

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Run the database migration script
2. Create a test user or reset an existing user's `first_login` to `true`
3. Log in with the user's credentials
4. Verify redirect to password change page
5. Change password and verify redirect to dashboard
6. Log out and log in again to verify normal flow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **User stuck on password change page**: Check if `first_login` field exists in users table
2. **Password validation errors**: Ensure password meets all requirements
3. **Redirect loops**: Verify middleware logic and public paths configuration

### Database Queries

```sql
-- Check if first_login field exists
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'users' AND column_name = 'first_login';

-- Reset a user to first-time login (for testing)
UPDATE users SET first_login = true WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Check user's first login status
SELECT email, first_login FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

## Future Enhancements

- Password history to prevent reuse
- Password expiration policies
- Admin override for password requirements
- Email notifications for password changes
