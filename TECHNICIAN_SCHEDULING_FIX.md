# Technician Scheduling Improvements

## Overview

This update fixes the issue with technician scheduling validation where conflicts were being detected incorrectly across different days. The system now properly validates that:

1. A technician cannot be booked for another job within a 3-hour period **on the same day**
2. The scheduling conflict detection is now accurate and only flags conflicts that occur on the same day

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Date Comparison Logic

The original code was comparing dates incorrectly, leading to false positives where jobs on different days were detected as conflicts. The fix implements a more accurate date comparison by:

- Creating separate date objects using year, month, and day components
- Comparing the timestamp values of these date objects
- Only considering conflicts when the dates match exactly

### 2. Updated TypeScript Helper Functions

The following files were updated:

- `lib/technician-scheduling.ts`: Fixed the helper function to properly compare dates
- `app/api/technicians/availability/route.ts`: Updated both the GET and POST endpoints to use the improved date comparison logic

### 3. Created Updated SQL Function

A new SQL function was created to handle technician availability checking directly in the database:

- `update_technician_validation.sql`: Contains the improved SQL function with proper date comparison

### 4. Added Deployment Scripts

To make applying the SQL changes easier:

- `apply_sql_function.sh`: Bash script for Linux/Mac users
- `apply_sql_function.ps1`: PowerShell script for Windows users

## How to Apply the Changes

### 1. Apply the SQL Function

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\apply_sql_function.ps1 YOUR_SUPABASE_URL YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x apply_sql_function.sh
./apply_sql_function.sh YOUR_SUPABASE_URL YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` and `YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY` with your actual Supabase URL and service role key.

### 2. Deploy Code Changes

Deploy the updated TypeScript files to your server using your normal deployment process.

## Testing the Changes

Test the improved scheduling system by:

1. Creating a job for a technician on a specific date and time
2. Attempting to schedule the same technician for another job:
   - On the same day within 3 hours (should show conflict)
   - On the same day outside the 3-hour window (should allow)
   - On a different day at the same time (should allow)

## Technical Details

### Date Comparison Method

The improved date comparison works by:

```typescript
// Create date objects with just the date parts
const targetDate = new Date(
  selectedDateTime.getFullYear(),
  selectedDateTime.getMonth(),
  selectedDateTime.getDate()
);

const jobDate = new Date(
  jobDateTime.getFullYear(),
  jobDateTime.getMonth(),
  jobDateTime.getDate()
);

// Compare the timestamp values
if (jobDate.getTime() !== targetDate.getTime()) {
  // Different days - no conflict
  return false;
}
```

This ensures we're only comparing the date portions without considering the time.

### Default Time Handling

For jobs that only have a date specified (without a specific time), the system assumes a default time of 9:00 AM for conflict checking purposes.
